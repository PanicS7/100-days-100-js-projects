	## Technology:
		HTML, CSS, Java Script, SCSS

	-- Create a list that accepts an item
	-- If the user tries to submit a blank item, the top container in the project alerts the user to add an item with an “alert” message. 
		If the user successfully adds an item, the top container alerts the user with a “success” message.
	-- Every time an item is added, the item is displayed in the DOM
	-- If the user clicks the “clear items” button, all items will be removed from the DOM
	-- If the user clicks just one of the delete item icons, only that item will be removed.
	** TO ADD:
		1. Local storage
