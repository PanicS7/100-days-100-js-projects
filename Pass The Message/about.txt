Pass The Message JavaScript Project

Exept this:
If no input is submitted, an alert should show (using the ‘show' class in the CSS file) in the “Last Message Delivered” section and then disappear after 2 second.

I add validation if input message is long, more than 250 char, alert should show and then disappear. Also if empty (no input) is submited nothing will heppend.
