Project Idea:
https://jsbeginners.com/tip-form-javascript-project/	
	
	-- I used SCSS for styling
	-- You should be able to use the calculator to enter an amount of a bill, the number of people who will split the bill, 
		and a selection as to how the service went.
	-- If a user forgets to add input or if the input is blank (or less than zero), 
		feedback should be alerted to the user and then go away after few seconds.
	-- During the calculation, a GIF animation should show for a couple seconds before the user's answer show up on the screen.
	-- After about few seconds, the calculator should reset all forms.
