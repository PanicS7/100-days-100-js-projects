	## Tehnology: 
		HTML, CSS, Java Script, SCSS

	-- You should be able to add new items and use the buttons to toggle completed items, edit items, or delete items.
	-- The clear button should clear your page.
	** TO ADD: 
		1. If you try to add an item without text, you should receive an alert telling the user to add an item.
		2. Data should persist since this app uses local storage.
